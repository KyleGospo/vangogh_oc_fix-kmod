# Description
A linux kernel module to override AMD Van Gogh APU PowerPlay limits for CPU.
This is useful if you have overclocked your SteamDeck but still want to use
PowerTools to set CPU clock limits. You do not need this for GPU overclocking.

Note that you still need a `pt_oc.json` to tell PowerTools that it can go that
hard. Conservesly, the way PowerTools works as of writing this (2023-03-06) will
not go past stock settings even if you have a `pt_oc.json` but not this module.
Similarly, you still need to set your maximum clock speed through the BIOS,
either through SmokelessUMAF or SD_Unlocker depending on your BIOS version.

# Disclaimer
This software is distributed under the terms of the GPLv3 license. Please refer

The module does a sanity check to ensure that it is trying to modify the right
value, but this may fail and write to some unknown place in kernel memory which
BADâ„¢.

# Usage
Run it in the current boot with `sudo modprobe vangogh_oc_fix cpu_default_soft_max_freq=<freq in Mhz>`
Add it to your kargs to keep it applied.
